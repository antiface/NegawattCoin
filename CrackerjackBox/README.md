CrackerjackBox
==============
* Security through Illegibility
* Merely a thought experiment
* The idea is to try to understand how people judge something to be nonsense (or not).
* It could help us understand social stigmatization processes better.
* The "CrackerjackBox" here is the Individual, one whose behavior is difficult to "Read".
* It depends on who is reading and what the purposes of the reading are.
* It also depends on Mr. CrackerjackBox himself, and whatever he or she is actually doing.
* In game-theoretic terms, total surveillance is a good thing, it fosters a context of Perfect or Complete Information.
* Knowing the power and strength of Information Asymmetries over adversaries, these things matter, and something as simple as a CrackerjackBox thought experiment can be quite helpful.
* Also, the idea could also be of an actual Box, like a LockBox.
* The persistent question would be:
    * A) Is it a Box?
    * B) What kind of Box is it? What is it used for? What is its purpose, its reason for being there?
* We clearly see here why a Philosophy of Objects can be of great assistance.
* Knowing what a "Box" is, philosophically in this case, can help inform us on what kind of attitude we might have towards the object.
* It might not matter what it is or is not, or whether it exists or does not. What matters is that critical philosophy in the Enlightenment and German Idealist line of thinking is still relevant in the 21st century.
* There is a Phenomenology here of that which is Visible and that which is Invisible.
* It links back to Literacy/Literacies and Reading on the one hand.
* On the other hand, it has to do with Senses, Sensing, and Sensors, with Understanding, and with Aesthetic Judgements or Judgements of Taste.
* Why should Judgements of Taste matter in the context of Security? This will shortly be revealed. Stay tuned. I may need to create a Repository on Kant's aesthetics, on his Critique of Judgement. For now, just think of the CrackerjackBox as a concept or conceptual persona in critical philosophy. Try to think of what the CrackerjackBox might look like and what it might be useful or used for in everyday practise and by whom.
