==============
* Security through Illegibility
* Merely a thought experiment
* The idea is to try to understand how people judge something to be nonsense (or not).
* It could help us understand social stigmatization processes better.
* The "CrackerjackBox" here is the Individual, one whose behavior is difficult to "Read".
* It depends on who is reading and what the purposes of the reading are.
* It also depends on Mr. CrackerjackBox himself, and whatever he or she is actually doing.
* In game-theoretic terms, total surveillance is a good thing, it fosters a context of Perfect or Complete Information.
* Knowing the power and strength of Information Asymmetries over adversaries, these things matter, and something as simple as a CrackerjackBox thought experiment can be quite helpful.
