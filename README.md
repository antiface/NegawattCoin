The NegawattCoin: The New Sustainable Technological Vision Powered by Invisible Forces of Reversible Pneumatic and Fluidic Noise Fields

* Negawatt power is a theoretical unit of power representing an amount of energy (measured in watts) saved. The energy saved is a direct result of energy conservation or increased energy efficiency. (Wikipedia).
* NegawattCoins take the idea of Negawatt power and "Carbon-as-Currency" to the next level. In the NegawattCoin model, energy savings or energy efficiencies are measured in bits.
