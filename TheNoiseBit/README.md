Noise-Bits & Their Transcendence
--------------------------------
* The noise-bit is a form of bug-creep more closely resembling syphillis
* It is a 1-bit garbage-computation that sets of an irreversible cascading failure
* The noise-bit can be purposive
* A situation can be generated where noise-bits cannot occur
* One avoids noise-bits by only building systems which can never be corrupted
